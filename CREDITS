The FSF.hu Foundation (http://fsf.hu/) supported and donated piler within the
"Free Software Application 2011 project." (http://fsf.hu/2011/09/27/szabad-szoftver-palyazat-2011/)

Nemeth Adam reviewed the web interface, and gave lots of useful hints and insights to
improve the web ui of piler.

Remi Smith improved the restricted auditor feature for a better multitenancy,
and invented the default theme.
